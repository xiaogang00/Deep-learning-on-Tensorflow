# Deep LSTM siamese network for text similarity

It is a tensorflow based implementation of deep siamese LSTM network to capture phrase/sentence similarity using character embeddings.

This code provides architecture for learning two kinds of tasks:

- Phrase similarity using char level embeddings

- Sentence similarity using char+word level embeddings
